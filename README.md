**UnitConverter** is a simple Java command-line app that helps you convert between everyday units of measurement. It’s designed with both US and UK standards in mind—making it extra useful for anyone moving, traveling, or working internationally.

Currently supports:
- 🌍 Length: miles ↔ kilometers, feet ↔ meters, inches ↔ centimeters
- ⚖️ Weight: pounds ↔ kilograms, stone ↔ kilograms
- 🌡 Temperature: Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
- 🥤 Volume: liters ↔ US/Imperial gallons and pints

Run it directly in your terminal with `javac` + `java`, or extend it to include more conversions later!
